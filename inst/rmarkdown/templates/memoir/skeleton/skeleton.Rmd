title: "Memoir Template"
output: html_document
---

This template is based on _Bookdown_ and the _Memoir_ LaTeX class to allow writing a book, a report, a PhD thesis, etc. in _R Markdown_.

The main file is _index.Rmd_ which contains the description of the book in its header. All other _.Rmd_ files in the folder contain a chapter. 
The _references.bib_ file contains the bibliography.

This file will have to be deleted, as well as _81-getting_started.Rmd_ and _82-syntax.Rmd_: they have to be replaced by the content of the book.

To get started, create a new R project from this folder.
Then open _index.Rmd_ and click on the _Build Book_ button in the _Build_ window of Rstudio.
