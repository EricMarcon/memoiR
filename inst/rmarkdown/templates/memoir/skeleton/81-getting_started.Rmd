# Getting Started {#getting_started}

_RStudio_ in version higher than 1 must be used.
The **bookdown** package must be installed.

For the creation of the PDF file, an installation of LaTeX is necessary.
Under Windows, use [MikTex](https://miktex.org/download).
The automatic download of missing packages (under Windows: MiKTeX settings, _Install missing packages=Yes_) is required.

The main file is _index.Rmd_ which contains the description of the book in its header. 
All other _.Rmd_ files in the folder contain a chapter: the order of chapters is that of the file names, sorted alphabetically.
The _references.bib_ file contains the bibliography.

The basic parameters of the project must be entered in the following files.


## index.Rmd

In the file header, enter the title of the work and the name of the author(s).

    title: "Memoir" 
    author: "Authors' names"

LaTeX specific options are:

- _documentclass_: the document class, necessarily _memoir_ for this template. 
The options of the _memoir_ class are listed, not to be changed normally.
- _fontfamily_: [font](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Fonts#Font_families), _lmodern_ by default.
- _linestretch_: line spacing, 1 by default.
- _papersize_: A4.
- _fontsize_: 11pt.
- _toc-depth_: number of levels in the table of contents, 3 by default.
- _lang_: fr-FR, en-US or en-GB (or any valid code[^1]), the main language.
- _otherlangs_: ignored since pandoc version 2[^2].
- _graphics_: yes mandatory to use the _graphics_ package needed for figures.
- *fig_crop*: yes to allow cropping of excess margins of figures.
- The back cover will display the abstract in French and English and the associated keywords if the _resume_, _keywords_, _abstract_ and _keywords_ instructions are present;
- _fourthpagefontsize_ gives the font size of the back cover, normalsize by default, to be adapted according to the length of the summaries.
The command must be recognized by LaTeX.

The parameters of the bibliography are:

- _bibliography_: files containing the references, [references.bib, packages.bib] by default. 
_package.bib_ is created by the first code chunk of the document: it allows packages declared with identifiers of the form `@R-package` to be cited. 
R itself is quoted by `@R-base`.
- _biblio-style_: the bibliographic style, authoryear-ibid by default.
- _cite-style_: the citation style in the LaTeX document, verbose-inote by default.
- _biblatexoptions_ contains the list of biblatex options, used to produce the PDF document.
- _link-citations_: yes to make the citations hyperlinks.
- _colorlinks_: yes to make the hyperlinks be displayed in color.

The cover will be:

- Book format if the _maintitlepage_ statement is present. 
The content of _epigraph_ will be written on page 2.
- the first page of the PDF file declared in the _pdftitlepage_ instruction if it is present.

Delete one of the two instructions in the header.

For a student thesis, prepare the cover page with Word, Powerpoint or a DTP program and save it in PDF format, in A4 size.
Only the first page of the PDF is used.


## _bookdown.yml

Enter the name of the Rmd file that will be the result of the merging of all chapters and choose if it should be destroyed after use.
The default options will suit most uses.

    book_filename: "MyBook"
    delete_merged_file: true


If the project is hosted on GitHub, indicate its address.
Otherwise, delete the line.

    repo: "https://github.com/GitHubID/Repository"


There is no need to fill in the keywords according to the language of the work.
The _language_ options are supported elsewhere.

    language:
      ui:
        chapter_name: "Chapter"


## _output.yml

Customize the table of contents in HTML format.

    config:
      toc:
        before: |
          <li><a href="./">Bookdown book</a></li>
        after: |
          <li><a href="https://github.com/GitHubID/Repository


## Multilingual documents

Only the main language of the document is declared in the header.
The titles will be written in this language (e.g.: Chapter / Chapitre).

To use other languages punctually in the text, they must be activated in `preamble.tex` in the `latex` folder.
American English and French are activated by default.

Changing the language has no effect in HTML, but changes punctuation, hyphenation... in PDF output.

To switch to English, insert the following code into the text:
```
\selectlanguage{english}
```

The language change in basic markdown format, 
```
::: {lang=en-US}
```
is not supported by R Markdown.
