# Getting Started {#getting_started}

_RStudio_ in version higher than 1 must be used.
The **bookdown** package must be installed.

For the creation of the PDF file, an installation of LaTeX is necessary.
Under Windows, use [MikTex](https://miktex.org/download).
The automatic download of missing packages (under Windows: MiKTeX settings, _Install missing packages=Yes_) is required.

The main file is _index.Rmd_ which contains the description of the book in its header. 
All other _.Rmd_ files in the folder contain a chapter: the order of chapters is that of the file names, sorted alphabetically.
The _references.bib_ file contains the bibliography.

The basic parameters of the project must be entered in the following files.


## index.Rmd {#index}

In the file header, enter the title of the work and the name of the author(s).

    title: "Title of the Memoir" 
    author: "Authors' names"
    
The date field may be kept to display the knitting date automatically.

The `github-repo` field contains the name of the repository of the project on GitHub.
It is used to build a link to the repository from the menu bar of the GitBook version of the document.

The cover will be:

- that of a book if the _maintitlepage_ statement is present. 
The content of _epigraph_ and _credits_ will be written on page 2, with `images/logo.pdf`.
- the first page of the PDF file declared in the _pdftitlepage_ instruction if it is present.

Delete one of the two instructions in the header or both covers will be built, like in the gallery[^811].

The languages are specified according to the IETF language tags, such as "en-US".
The main language (`lang`) is that of the structure of the document, translating elements such as "chapter".
The other languages (`otherlangs`) can be used to switch language inside the PDF document to benefit from correct hyphenation.


LaTeX specific options are:

- _papersize_: A4.
- _fontsize_: 11pt.
- _toc-depth_: number of levels in the table of contents, 3 by default.

Bibliography is managed by BibLaTeX, whose options should not be changed.

The name of the `.bib` file containing the references is in `bibliography`.
It must be entered with its `.bib` extension.

The back cover appears in PDF outputs only.
It is designed to to display abstract and keyword in several languages if necessary.
The items of `backcover` are a list:

- language: the name of the language, that will be passed to the LaTeX command `\selectlanguage{}`.
- abstract: the content of the abstract.
- keywords: a list of keywords.
- abstractlabel and keywordlabel: the localized text to print before abstract and keywords.

`backcoverfontsize` may be changed better fit the page size, according to the length of the abstracts.

Some options should not be modified, including:

- _documentclass_: the document class is _memoir_ for this template. 
The options of the _memoir_ class are listed, not to be changed normally.
- *fig_crop*: yes to allow cropping of excess margins of figures.
GhostScript must be installed.
If it is not, or in order to save computing time, the option may be set to `no`.

Some may be added to the header:

- _fontfamily_: [font](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Fonts#Font_families), _lmodern_ by default.
- _linestretch_: line spacing, 1 by default.

The parameters of the bibliography are:

- _bibliography_: files containing the references, [references.bib, packages.bib] by default. 
_package.bib_ is created by the first code chunk of the document: it allows packages declared with identifiers of the form `@R-package` to be cited. 
R itself is quoted by `@R-base`.
- _biblio-style_: the bibliographic style, authoryear-ibid by default.
- _cite-style_: the citation style in the LaTeX document, verbose-inote by default.
- _biblatexoptions_ contains the list of biblatex options, used to produce the PDF document.
- _link-citations_: yes to make the citations hyperlinks.
- _colorlinks_: yes to make the hyperlinks be displayed in color.

For a student thesis, prepare the cover page with Word, Powerpoint or a DTP program and save it in PDF format, in A4 size.
Only the first page of the PDF is used.


## _bookdown.yml

Enter the name of the Rmd file that will be the result of the merging of all chapters and choose if it should be destroyed after use.
It will also be the name of the PDF and Word files.
The default options will suit most uses.

    book_filename: "MyBook"
    delete_merged_file: true


If the project is hosted on GitHub, indicate its address.
Otherwise, delete the line.

    repo: "https://github.com/GitHubID/Repository"

The knitted files are stored in the output directory.
`docs` is the good choice for GitHub Pages.


## _output.yml

Customize the table of contents in HTML format.

    config:
      toc:
        before: |
          <li><a href="./">Bookdown book</a></li>
        after: |
          <li><a href="https://github.com/GitHubID/Repository


## Multilingual documents

Only the main language of the document is declared in the header.
The titles will be written in this language (e.g.: Chapter / Chapitre).

To use other languages punctually in the text, they must be activated in `preamble.tex` in the `latex` folder.
American English and French are activated by default.

Changing the language has no effect in HTML, but changes punctuation, hyphenation... in PDF output.

To switch to English, insert the following code into the text:
```
\selectlanguage{english}
```

The language change in basic markdown format, 
```
::: {lang=en-US}
```
is not supported by R Markdown.
