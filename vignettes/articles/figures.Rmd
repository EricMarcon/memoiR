Large margins in PDF memoirs allow storing references and footnotes (actually sidenotes) while improving readability of the text in a narrower column.
An example is [here](https://ericmarcon.github.io/MesuresBioDiv2/MesuresBD.pdf).

By default, figures cover the width of the text column and their caption is placed inside the margin.
Two alternative layouts are available: margin figures and full-width figures that extend into the margin.

# Layouts

This copy of a page with all three types of figures illustrates their differences.
```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figures.png")
```


# Syntax

Default figures are declared in code chunks which contain the appropriate code: `plot()`, `ggplot()` or `include_graphics()`.
The chunk header contains the figure caption or, better, a reference to it.
The referenced caption, declared outside the chunk by `(ref:chunk_label)`, allows all text formats and contents.
Its only limit is that it must be a single paragraph.

## Standard figure

This code produces a standard figure.

````
(ref:pressure1) Standard figure
```{r}`r ''`
#| label: pressure1
#| fig.cap: "(ref:pressure1)"
#| echo: false
plot(pressure)
```
````

## Margin figure

A margin figure is obtained by changing the figure environment (`fig.env: 'marginfigure'`) in the code chunk options.

````
(ref:pressure2) Margin figure
```{r}`r ''`
#| label: pressure2
#| fig.cap: "(ref:pressure2)"
#| fig.env: 'marginfigure'
#| echo: false
plot(pressure)
```
````

## Full-width figure

A full-width figure is obtained by changing the figure environment (`fig.env: 'figure'`) and width (`out.width: '\\widthw'`).

````
(ref:pressure3) Full-width figure
```{r}`r ''`
#| label: pressure3
#| fig.cap: "(ref:pressure3)"
#| fig.env: 'figure'
#| out.width: '\\widthw'
#| echo: false
plot(pressure)
```
````

The figure must be centered (`fig.align: 'center'`), which is by default in **memoiR** templates.
