Producing a PDF file from a R Markdown (`.Rmd`) document requires several steps:

- **knitR** runs the code chunks to produce results and figures.
- **bookdown** [@Xie2016] [or **rmarkdown**: @Xie2018] produces a plain Markdown document.
**memoiR** templates all rely on **bookdown** to benefit from cross references and figure/table numbering.
- Pandoc is run to produce either directly an HTML document or a LaTeX file (`.tex`).
The bibliography of HTML documents is processed by Pandoc at this stage.
**memoiR** templates delay it for LaTeX documents.
*- A LaTeX engine is run to compile the LaTeX file and produce a PDF document.
It uses reference management software (BibTeX or Biber) and a LaTeX package (natbib or biblatex) for bibliography. 
)

memoiR templates rely on XeLaTeX to compile LaTeX documents to PDF files.
Among XeLaTex advantages over the classical pdflatex engine, including native UTF-8 encoding, language support by Polyglossia rather than Babel (required by pdflatex) is similar to that of Pandoc to produce HTML formats, based on IETF language tags such as "en-US".
In short, this solution is simpler and more robust.

In the **memoir** template, bibliography is managed by biber and biblatex.
This appears to be the best solution for long documents, allowing in-margin citations and cross-references from the bibliography to the text containing the citation.
The bibliographic style is _verbose-inote_ by default: it can be changed in the memoir header.

In short documents, i.e. articles and presentations, bibtex and natbib are preferred because the advanced formatting abilities of biblatex are not very useful, more citation styles are available (`.bst` files) and many journals expect them to be used.
