# Content

This package provides templates to publish well-formatted documents both in HTML and PDF formats. 
Documents can be produced locally or hosted on GitHub.
GitHub actions can be used for automatic updates.

Templates include:

- "Stylish Article": an article for self archiving. The HTML versions are optimized to be read online and the PDF version is a two-column, well formatted article to be printed.
- "Simple Article":  simpler than the stylish article. The HTML versions are the same and the PDF version follows the classical 'article' LaTeX template.
- "Beamer Slideshow": the HTML version is either IOSlide or Slidy and the PDF version is a Beamer slideshow.
- "Memoir": a book template based on memoir. The HTML version is a GitBook and the PDF version is formatted by the memoir LaTeX template.

Available HTML formats for articles are:

- GitBook: `bookdown::gitbook`
- Bookdown's HTML format (`bookdown::html_document2`)
- Any format from the **rmdformats** package. `rmdformats::downcute` is by default. See the package documentation for other possibilities.


# Getting started

In RStudio, create a new R Markdown document and chose the appropriate template in the wizard.

Use the menu "File > New File... > R Markdown...", click on _From template_ and pick up the template you want in the list.

Chose the location to create the document and the name of its directory.

Make the new folder an RStudio Project: use the menu "File / New Project...", click on "Existing Directory" and select the directory created previously.

Articles and slideshows are produced by clicking on the **Knit** button of the Source pane of their Rmd file.
Memoirs are produced by clicking on the **Build Book** button of the Build pane.

Push your project to GitHub and activate GitHub Pages to make your documents readable online.
The following functions help simplify that task:

- `build_gitignore()` to create a `.gitignore` file. Activate git source control then.
- `build_readme()` to create a `README.md` file, that will be the GitHub Pages index of articles or slideshows.
- `build-githubpages()` to move knitted documents (articles or slideshows) to the `docs` folder.

Documents can be knitted by GitHub Action if continuous integration in activated:

- In GitHub Settings, enter two secrets:
    - EMAIL: the email address of the author,
    - GH-PAT: a valid Personal Access Token.
- run `build_ghworkflow()` to create the necessary script (`.github/workflows/check.yml`).
