# Content

This package provides templates to publish well-formatted documents both in HTML and PDF formats. 
Documents can be produced locally or hosted on GitHub.
GitHub actions can be used for automatic updates.

Templates include:

- "Stylish Article": an article for self archiving. The HTML version is optimized to be read online and the PDF version is a two-column, well formatted article to be printed.
- "Simple Article":  simpler than the stylish article. The HTML version is the same and the PDF version follows the classical 'article' LaTeX template.
- "Beamer Slideshow": the HTML version is either IOSlide or Slidy and the PDF version is a Beamer slideshow.
- "Memoir": a book template based on memoir. The HTML version is a GitBook and the PDF version is formatted by the memoir LaTeX template.


# Getting started

In RStudio, create a new R Markdown document and chose the appropriate template in the wizard.

Use the menu "File > New File... > R Markdown...", click on _From template_ and pick up the template you want in the list.

Chose the location to create the document and the name of its directory.

Make the new folder an RStudio Project: use the menu "File / New Project...", click on "Existing Directory" and select the directory created previously.

Articles and slideshows are produced by clicking on the **Knit** button of the Source pane of their Rmd file.
Memoirs are produced by clicking on the **Build Book** button of the Build pane.
